CS 4348.502 Project 2 - Bank

There are 5 files in this project:

Bank: 
    This is the driver class. Run the project using this file

Customer: 
    This class represents the customers in this project. It contains all methods and attributes of customers.

Manager:
    This class represents the Manager. It only consists of one static Semaphore, but allows for further implementation of the manager separately this way.

Safe:
    Similar to the manager class, this class only contains one static Semaphore to represent the safe.

Teller:
    Similar to the Customer class, this contains all methods and attributes of the tellers.

To run this project, navigate to this file and use javac Bank.java Customer.java Manager.java Safe.java Teller.java Teller.java,  and then run the project by using java Bank

This project should work using Java 8 and further as I tested the code in a Java 8 environment.

If this does not work, try taking from the GitHub itself: https://github.com/justi-lai/OSProject2
